# Forbes Royal Schools Website Project

Welcome to the Forbes Royal Schools website project!

This is a simple website created as a starting point to learn about web development (HTML & CSS) and version control using Git and GitHub Desktop.

**What you will learn:**

*   Basic HTML structure (`index.html`)
*   Basic CSS styling (`style.css`) to make the page look good
*   How to use **GitHub Desktop** to track your changes, save your work (commit), and share it (push)

**Project Files:**

*   `index.html`: The main page of the website.
*   `style.css`: The styles that control how `index.html` looks.
*   `README.md`: This file! It explains the project and gives you instructions.

**How to View the Website:**

1.  Open the `ForbesRoyalSchoolsWebsite` folder you created.
2.  Double-click on the `index.html` file. It should open in your web browser!

## Using GitHub Desktop: Your Guide to Saving Your Work

GitHub Desktop is a tool that helps you use Git, a system for tracking changes to your files. Think of it like having a "save history" for your code.

Here's how to use it for this project:

**Step 1: Install GitHub Desktop & Sign In**

*   If you haven't already, download and install GitHub Desktop from [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com/).
*   Sign in with your GitHub account. If you don't have one, you'll need to create one on [github.com](https://github.com/).

**Step 2: Create a New Repository**

This tells Git to start tracking your project folder.

1.  Open GitHub Desktop.
2.  Go to `File` > `New Repository...`.
3.  Fill in the details:
    *   **Name:** `forbes-royal-schools-website` (or similar)
    *   **Local path:** Click `Choose...` and select the `ForbesRoyalSchoolsWebsite` folder you created on your computer.
    *   **Ignore:** Choose `None`.
    *   **License:** Choose `None`.
    *   **Initialize this repository with a README:** Make sure this box **IS** checked.
4.  Click the **Create Repository** button.

**Step 3: Add Your Website Files**

Now, put the `index.html` and `style.css` files you created earlier *into* the `ForbesRoyalSchoolsWebsite` folder that GitHub Desktop is tracking.

**Step 4: See Your Changes in GitHub Desktop**

1.  Go back to the GitHub Desktop application.
2.  You should see a list of changes under the "Changes" tab.

**Step 5: Commit Your Changes (Save Point!)**

A "commit" is like taking a snapshot of your project files at a specific moment.

1.  Look at the bottom left of the GitHub Desktop window.
2.  There are two boxes:
    *   **Summary (required):** Type a short, clear message about what you did. For this first commit, a good message is `Add initial website files (HTML and CSS)`.
    *   **Description (optional):** You can add more details here if needed.
3.  Make sure the files you want to save are checked in the "Changes" list above.
4.  Click the **Commit to main** button.

**Step 6: Publish Your Repository (Put it on GitHub.com)**

1.  After committing, a button should appear in the middle of the window saying **Publish repository**. Click it.
2.  A window will pop up.
    *   **Name:** Should be the same as your local repo name.
    *   **Keep this code private:** Check or uncheck this based on instructions.
    *   **Organization:** Leave this as `None`.
3.  Click the **Publish Repository** button.

**Step 7: Make More Changes & Repeat the Commit/Push Cycle**

Now that your project is set up, here's the process you'll follow every time you make changes:

1.  Open your project folder and edit `index.html` or `style.css` (or add new files).
2.  Save your changes in your code editor.
3.  Open GitHub Desktop.
4.  Go to the **Changes** tab. You will see the files you modified listed.
5.  Write a clear **Summary** for your changes.
6.  Click the **Commit to main** button.
7.  After committing, a new button will likely appear in the middle saying **Push origin**. Click this button to send your new commit up to GitHub.com.

**Remember this cycle: Edit Files -> Save Files -> See Changes in GitHub Desktop -> Write Commit Summary -> Commit -> Push Origin**

That's it! You are now using Git with GitHub Desktop to manage your website project.
